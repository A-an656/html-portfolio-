I am Anand Utagikar, a dedicated 4th-year B.Tech student in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) branch. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am also a professional cricketer, having participated in the U-23 state camp in Goa and an all-India camp at D.Batu University in 2024. Currently, I am deeply engaged in learning coding, with aspirations to become a developer in the near future. Balancing my passion for cricket and my commitment to becoming a successful developer is both challenging and rewarding, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
